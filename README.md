# Fitbit demo
This client application retrieves the daily step count for a week using the Fitbit API.  
To run, you first must include your application credentials in get-access-token.py, run the script, and then copy the access token obtained into steps.py.  

Note: The Fitbit API requires Python 3.9.13 or earlier and cherrpy.  Install fitbit and cherrypy as part of a Python virtual environment.
